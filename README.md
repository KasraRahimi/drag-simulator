# Drag Simulator :dash:
This is a small project whose goal is to help me understand how to simulate simple drag.
This project'll make use of the pygame module to display the simualtion.

## Features :books:
* A circle representing the player's ship
* Drag simulates using a simplified formula
* Adjustable thrust
* Ability to control the ship in four directions

## Controls :video_game:

* ``w``: Move up
* ``a``: Move left
* ``s``: Move down
* ``d``: Move right
* ``Up arrow``: Increase thrust
* ``Down arrow``: Decrease thrust

## Getting Started :rocket:
To use this simulator, make sure you have python installed. Then you can install it through the terminal with git
```
git clone https://github.com/KasraRahimi/drag-simulator.git
cd drag-simulator
python drag.py
```
